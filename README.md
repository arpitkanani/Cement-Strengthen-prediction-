# Cement Strength Prediction – End-to-End ML Project

An end-to-end Machine Learning application to predict **compressive strength of concrete** using input material composition.
The project includes **EDA, model training, MLflow experiment tracking, and Flask-based deployment**.

---

##  Project Overview
This project predicts cement strength using supervised regression models.  
It follows an industry-style ML pipeline with modular code structure, experiment tracking using **MLflow**, and cloud deployment on **Render**.

---

##  Problem Statement
To predict the **compressive strength of cement** based on its material composition such as cement, water, slag, ash, and aggregates.
